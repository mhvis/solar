title: Samil Power inverter communication protocol
---

This document describes my findings on the communication protocol used for
talking with a Samil Power inverter over the network.
A Python implementation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mhvis/solar).

## Relevant inverters

* SolarRiver TL series
* SolarRiver TL-D series
* SolarLake TL series

This is based on the notion that the
[SolarPower Browser V3](https://web.archive.org/web/20190720131520/http://www.samilpower.com/service.php)
software supports these inverters according to the Samil Power website.

The following inverters have been confirmed to work with the protocol:

* SolarRiver 3400 TL-D
* SolarRiver 4500 TL-D
* SolarRiver 5200 TL-D
* SolarLake 17K

## Discovery

The following message is broadcasted over UDP port 1300 to discover inverters in
the network:

```
0000   55 aa 00 40 02 00 0b 49 20 41 4d 20 53 45 52 56  U..@...I AM SERV
0010   45 52 04 3a                                      ER.:
```

The message format is explained later, the payload here is `I AM SERVER`.
Inverters will respond by opening a TCP connection to the host on port 1200.

## Messages

When a TCP connection is made, the server (you) can make requests. The inverter
will send a response for your request. For me the time between a request and
response was typically 1.5 seconds.

All messages have the following format, in order:

* 2 bytes, always 0x55 0xaa.
* 2 bytes which seem to be an identifier for the type of request/response.
* 1 byte which I don't know, the value does not seem to matter.
* 2 bytes: an integer denoting the payload length.
* The payload.
* 2 bytes at the end, the checksum, a sum of the previous bytes.

Integers in messages are always 2 bytes and big endian unless stated
otherwise. Normally they are unsigned, except for when the value can
become negative (e.g. for internal temperature).

Strings are null-terminated if they are shorter than their space in the
packet, which is determined by the protocol.
Bytes after the 0 byte are ignored.
It seems that an ASCII encoding is used, non-ASCII characters such as `Ã©` are not supported.


### Model/version info

Request has identifier `01 03 02` (hex), empty payload and checksum `01 05`.

Response has identifier `01 83 00`. Payload:

```
0x00   31 20 20 34 35 30 30 56 31 2e 33 30 52 69 76 65  1  4500V1.30Rive
0x10   72 20 34 35 30 30 54 4c 2d 44 00 20 53 61 6d 69  r 4500TL-D. Sami
0x20   6c 50 6f 77 65 72 00 20 20 20 20 20 44 57 34 31  lPower.     DW41
0x30   33 42 38 30 38 30 00 00 00 00 00 00 56 31 2e 33  3B8080......V1.3
0x40   30 56 31 2e 33 30 32                             0V1.302
```

The payload will be of exactly length 71 and consists (only) of
possibly null-terminated strings. The meaning and offset of each string:

* 0x00 Device type:
  * "1" = Single-phase inverter
  * "2" = Three-phase inverter
  * "3" = SolarEnvi Monitor
  * "4" = R-phase inverter of the three combined single-phase ones (?)
  * "5" = S-phase inverter of the three combined single-phase ones (?)
  * "6" = T-phase inverter of the three combined single-phase ones (?)
* 0x01 VA rating ("  4500")
* 0x07 Firmware version ("V1.30")
* 0x0c Model name ("River 4500TL-D")
* 0x1c Manufacturer ("SamilPower")
* 0x2c Serial number ("DW413B8080")
  * This value seems to have influence on how status values should be interpreted
* 0x3c Communication version ("V1.30")
* 0x41 Other version ("V1.30")
* 0x46 General (?, protocol version??) ("2")
  * This also seems to influence on how status values should be interpreted, in a minor way

Source: [ID Info](#dataid-infodw413b8080csv).


### Status data format

This requests the inverter for the specification of the data types that are present in the status data response, and also in which order they will appear in that response.

Request identifier: `01 00 02`, checksum: `01 02`, empty payload.

Response identifier: `01 80 00`. Each byte in the payload specifies a type of data that will appear in the status data response according to the list below. The order of the type specifications as they appear in the payload will be the same as the order in which the data values will appear in the status response. Each status value in the status response will always be 2 bytes long, which results in that the payload length of the status response will effectively be always twice the length of this format response. An example payload for this format response is `00 01 02 04 05 09 0a 0c 11 17 18 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 20 21 22 27 28 31 32 33 34 35 36`. The known data types that can appear in the list are given here, note that these are not offsets but a possible value of a byte in the payload.

* 0x00 Internal temperature in tenths of degrees Celcius, two's complement number (375 = 37.5 degrees Celcius)
* 0x01 PV1 voltage in decivolts (2975 = 297.5 V)
* 0x02 PV2 voltage in decivolts
* 0x04 PV1 current in deciampere
* 0x05 PV2 current in deciampere
* 0x07 Energy total in tenths of kWh first part

* 0x1a
* 0x1b
* 0x1c ? These unknown types 0x17 till 0x22 may be for indicating fault codes but I have not looked into it
* 0x1d
* 0x1e
* 0x1f
* 0x20
* 0x21
* 0x22
* 0x27 PV1 input power in watt

* 0x52 Three-phase inverter only, S phase: grid voltage in tenths of volts
* 0x53 Three-phase inverter only, S phase: grid frequency in hundreds of hertz
* 0x71 Three-phase inverter only, T phase: current to grid in tenths of ampere
* 0x72 Three-phase inverter only, T phase: grid voltage in tenths of volts
* 0x73 Three-phase inverter only, T phase: grid frequency in hundreds of hertz


### Status data (voltage, temperature, et cetera)

Request identifier: `01 02 02`, empty payload and checksum `01 04`.

Response identifier: `01 82` and an inconsistent third byte which is usually 0. The payload is a list of integer values where each value is 2 bytes long and big endian. The values that you can expect in the payload are documented in the earlier section on the status data format. An example payload:

```
0000   01 77 0b 9f 0b f6 00 15 00 14 00 00 28 40 00 01
0010   01 da 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0020   00 00 00 00 00 00 02 88 02 6f 00 37 09 14 13 86
0030   04 ee 00 01 b1 cc
```

* 0x00 Internal temperature 0x01 0x77 = 375 = 37.5 degrees Celcius
* 0x02 PV1 voltage of 297.5 V
* ...
* 0x0a Total operation time 0x00 0x00 0x28 0x40 = 10304 hours
* ...

### Historical data

Request identifier: `06 01 02`. The payload has length 2 and consists of two integers with length 1 to specify the period for which you want to receive data. The first integer indicates the last two digits of the start year, the second integer indicates the last two digits of the end year.

The server responds with multiple messages until all requested data is
transferred. The identifier of each message is `06 61 00`.
For each day of the year a number of packets is sent.
These packets have a data string with them which must be concatenated with the other packets of the same day,
to form the data for a complete day.
The data for a complete day is a CSV formatted string.
Explanation of the payload of a single packet:

* 0x00 Last two digits of the year of current packet (0-99)
* 0x01 Month number (1-12)
* 0x02 Day number (1-31)
* 0x03 ? for me it is always `00 00 01 38`
* 0x07 4-byte integer: specifies the number of data packets that will be sent for the current day
* 0x0b 4-byte integer: sequence number of the data packet for the current day
* 0x0f One of the parts of a textual ASCII csv encoding
for the complete day, which looks like shown below in the example.
The CSV values are separated by CR+LF newlines (\r\n, `0x0d0a`).

Example of the payloads for a full day, in 3 packets:

```

When all data is transferred, the inverter sends a closing packet to notify this.
This packet has identifier `06 81 00` and empty payload.

### Communications module

Request identifier: `04 00 02`, checksum: `01 05`, empty payload.

Response identifier: `04 80 00`.  Payload is 161 bytes

* 0000 installed comms module, 01 = GPRS, 02 = WIFI, 03 = 'No Module' (1 byte)
* 0001 WIFI SSID (35 char)
* 0024 WIFI Password (60 char) [1]
* 0060 GPRS PIN (4 char)
* 0064 GPRS Centre Number (30 char)
* 0082 GPRS Customer Number (30 char)
* 00a0 Module in use (1 byte). `00` not in use,  `80` (128) in use. [2] 

[1] Password is sent in the clear!! but hidden in Samil Power Browser.

[2] Parameters cannot be updated from the app if this value is not zero - presumably to prevent locking
you out of the inverter.

```

#### Set WIFI or GPRS Parameters

Samil Power Browser protects these requests to change parameters by the owner 'write' password which
seems to be hardcoded to 'samilpower88'.

WIFI request: `05 00 00`, payload is the WIFI structure from above
* 0000 WIFI SSID (35 char)
* 0023 WIFI Password (60 char)

GPRS request: `05 01 00`, payload is the GPRS structure from above
* 0000 PIN (4 char)
* 0004 Centre (30 char)
* 0022 Customer (20 char)

Response identifier is the same as the request identifier with a 1 byte payload, either `06` = success, anything else
is considered a failure by Samil Power Browser.
* WIFI `05 00 00 00 01 06 01 0b`
* GPRS `05 01 00 00 01 06 01 0c`

Note the inverter will reboot after a successful change which will reset any current connection.

### Unknown message 2

Request identifier: `01 09 02`, checksum: `01 0b`, empty payload.

Response identifier: `01 89 00`, payload was for me `55 0c 00 00`.


## Packet data samples

This is a collection of packets I used for determining the protocol.
The inverter used is SolarRiver 4500 TL-D, which connected to an installation of the official
[SolarPower Browser V3](https://web.archive.org/web/20190720131520/http://www.samilpower.com/service.php)
client.

Aside from these samples, I also used a script for simulating an inverter,
by having the official SolarPower Browser V3 software tricked into connecting to that fake inverter,
to test different inverter types or extreme values.
